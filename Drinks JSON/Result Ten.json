Hastings Cameron, a bartender at several Madison, Wisc., bars, including Imaginary Bar, describes this cocktail tribute to the Green Bay Packers as a “perverse Shamrock shake,” in which the mint and fennel of Strega are fortified by similar notes in gin from Death’s Door Spirits, a Wisconsin distillery.\n“I grew up in Chicago rooting for the Packers as a little contrarian,” says Cameron. “As an adult, I still love blue and orange (mostly orange) but couldn’t possibly care less about the Bears, or the Cubs for that matter,” he says. While this drink was purely aesthetically inspired by the Packers’ team colors—“Lil Wayne didn’t need anything more than the team’s colors to inspire this,” says Cameron—it involves a pretty complex matcha foam, evidence of Cameron’s tendency toward molecular gastronomy-like bartending.",
