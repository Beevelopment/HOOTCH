Featuring traditional Mexican flavorings such as fresh sugar cane, guavas and tejocotes (a crabapple-type fruit), the punch is spiked with a healthy dose of rum and served piping hot to ward off any winter chills. Here in the U.S., it can be hard to find these items fresh. So this recipe relies on easy-to-find ingredients that lend their Mexican flair to an irresistible rum punch.",
