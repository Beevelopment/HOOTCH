"Bacardí Mary Pickford","https://cdn.liquor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/05111053/mary-pickford-720x720-recipe-v2.jpg","Actress Mary Pickford was known as America’s Sweetheart in the 1920s, when she landed in Cuba to shoot a film with husband Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. As the story goes, Fred Kaufman, one of the many American bartenders who relocated to the island during Prohibition, dreamed up this BACARDÍ® rum-based concoction special for the silent-film star. Some recipes call for prepackaged juice only, but according to Basil Woon’s 1928 book, “When It’s Cocktail Time in Cuba,” it’s not a Mary Pickford without the addition of freshly squeezed pineapple juice. We tend to agree.","BACARDÍ Superior rum","2 parts",""
