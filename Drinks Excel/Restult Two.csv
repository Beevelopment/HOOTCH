Of course, he says, any quality pink bubbles will do to make this flower-forward, sweet, tart and festive cocktail. Aside from the rosé, the use of Nikolaihof elderflower syrup is a key ingredient to help give it a romantic tinge—something you can imagine tasting in the garden of a queen. Another suggestion to give the drink a bit of a kick: Add an ounce of cucumber gin like Hendrick’s to help enhance both the booze level and that pretty floral essence.","Sassetti sparkling rosé wine","90 ml",""

This is the kind of drink that could easily replace the Margarita at a backyard barbecue, if anything for the complexity and festive color.

The elegant space is enhanced by general manager and bar director Ashwin Vilkhu’s cocktails, showcasing Indian ingredients while riffing on classics. Inspired by a bedtime elixir of warm milk, honey and turmeric (which Ashwin’s mom would give him before bed), the Anti-Inflammatory also plays off a New Orleans’ staple cocktail, the Brandy Milk Punch. The soothing drink luxuriously combines cognac with tumeric-infused coconut milk and honey syrup over crushed ice, garnished with a cilantro sprig and drops of chili oil.","Cognac","45 ml",""
